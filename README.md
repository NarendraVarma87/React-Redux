# Redux Counter App

A simple React application showcasing the use of React-Redux and Redux Toolkit to manage state for a counter.

## Summary

This project serves as a basic template for a React app implementing Redux for state management. It includes a counter component with increment, decrement, and reset functionalities.

## Getting Started

Counter Operations:
Increment: Increase the counter value by 1.
Decrement: Decrease the counter value by 1.
Reset: Set the counter value back to 0.

State Management:
Utilizes Redux and Redux Toolkit for efficient state management.
Demonstrates the use of a Redux slice to define the counter state and associated actions.

React Components:

Provides a clear separation of concerns between UI components and state management.
